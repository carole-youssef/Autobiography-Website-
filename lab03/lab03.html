		<h2 style= "color:#702777;">CSS Media Queries</h2>
			<p style="text-align: center; font-size:1.2rem; ">
			For Part A, we were asked to create a responsive webpage using CSS media queries. This was my first time implementing a responsive webage, and it came
			with its challeneges. With CSS media queries, I struggled to adapt the layout of elements such as text and images, since they must be able to adapt to all
			screen sizes. It look me quite some time to figure out the appropriate layouts, as well as aligning elements in a way where there is no overlap and everything 
			is clear. Some of the "col-" fluid grids were confusing to understand at first but eventually I understood the task and implemented them where needed.</p>

		<h2 style= "color:#702777;">Bootstrap Framework</h2>
		<p style="text-align: center; font-size:1.2rem; ">
			For Part B, we were asked to create the same responsive webpage as before, but using the Bootstrap Framework instead. I found this webpage to be a lot easier in
			many aspects, such as having the built in row and column classes to easily make layouts that adjust to certain widths, which is the main goal of responsiveness.
			This also saved me lots of time and effort, which I liked. Some things I needed to adjust in this webpage was the font sizing, images and some of the containers. 
			However, other than these minor issues, I preferred working with Bootstrap more and would likely use this framework in my future projects.
